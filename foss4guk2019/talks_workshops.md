<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Talks & Workshops</h2>

We're currently planning our talks & workshops and at this stage, we'd really likely to hear what may interest you. If you'd like to let us know about topics you'd like to see covered, then please fill out this **<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Fp64xTrbHhrbM0Wa2" target="_blank">online survey</a>** and we'll gather the responses.

A **call for talks / workshops** will go out in **early 2019**, so get thinking of your ideas and watch this space.
