<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Talks & Workshops</h2>

As of 30th April, our <span style="color:#6c932c; font-weight:bold;">call for talks and workshops is now closed</span>.

We've had lots of amazing submissions on both fronts, so we're looking forward to a fantastic few days! It'll be a friendly, relaxed conference where we discuss all things free, open source and geo-related.

Tickets will be no more than <strong>Â£40 per day</strong>, with concession rates available too.

<h3 style="margin-top:40px;">Unconference</h3>
If you've missed the talks deadline but still have something you'd like to say, there will also be an opportunity during to contribute to an 'unconference' session - this is likely to be an informal session of lightning-style talks (more details closer to the event).
