## FOSS4G UK Online 2020
OSGeo:UK are running a one day online FOSS4G event on 17th June 2020. This will give us all a little FOSS4G fix in this strange time, and make a small contribution to the big holes left by the cancellation of other FOSS4G events. We'll share some of the work we’ve been doing since the world changed, and maybe pave the way for more online events in future.

## Programme
We welcome technical talks, demos, user stories (particularly ones about the use of FOSS4G tech during the Covid19 crisis), thought pieces… In fact we welcome any talks based on Open Source Geo (and not pushing a sales message).

We're also hoping to offer some short workshops where you can play along or just site back and marvel.
