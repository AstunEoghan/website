[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) are running a one day online FOSS4G event on 17th June 2020. This will give us all a little FOSS4G fix in this strange time, and make a small contribution to the big holes left by the cancellation of IRL FOSS4G events. We'll share some of the work we’ve been doing since the world changed, and maybe pave the way for more online events in future.

## Programme
The full session listing is [here](sessions.html) - the detailed schedule will be published later this week. There are three parallel streams with specific themes, and all sessions will be recorded so you can catch up later if there are clashes between your favourite topics.
