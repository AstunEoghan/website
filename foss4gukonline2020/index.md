[OSGeo:UK](https://uk.osgeo.org/) are running a one day online FOSS4G event on 17th June 2020. This will give us all a little FOSS4G fix in this strange time, and make a small contribution to the big holes left by the cancellation of IRL FOSS4G events. We'll share some of the work weâ€™ve been doing since the world changed, and maybe pave the way for more online events in future.

## Programme
Submissions are now closed - we are working on the programme and will announce it as soon as we can - it will include technical talks, demos, user stories, and thought pieces.

The final programme will be published in late May - we're planning on some great keynotes too.

## Helping out
