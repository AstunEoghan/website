# OSGeo:UK AGM 2020

It's time for the OSGeo:UK AGM again - last year we were able to hold it in summy Edinburgh, this year we will be online again. It will be held on **Wednesday October 28th from 12pm - 1pm**. As in previous years, we'll use a Google Hangout with details sent to the [OSGeo:UK mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk) and posted here on the morning of the 28th. 

The proposed agenda is [here](/agm/agm2020.html) - please post any items you would like added to it on the mailing list.

The AGM is open to anyone working in or interested in open source GIS in the UK - if you are not already, please sign up to the mailing list for updates on all things OS GIS UK, and/or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/osgeouk). We'd really like as many people as possible to dial in for a chat about OSGeo in the UK - we could do with some new voices in the discussion!
