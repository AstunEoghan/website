## [FOSS4G UK 2016](/foss4guk2016/) : Unconference and Surgery

We'll be holding an unconference session where you can sign up to talk for 15 minutes on whatever you like. The only caveats are that it must be polite, it must have something to do with open source, and there must be no sneaky promotion of your company or service.

We're also planning to hold a surgery, where you will have the opportunity to ask experts and fellow users about things you're struggling with. More details to follow.
