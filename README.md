# FOSS4G UK 2016 Website

## Updating the site

To get a local copy of the repository clone it using git. There is only one
`gh-pages` branch where the content and template lives.

You can then edit the content and test locally after [setting up your pages
site locally with
Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

Once you're happy with your changes and wish to publish them:

* Pull any upstream changes, merge and test again
* Commit your changes and push to the gh-pages branch
* Wait a few minutes for the Jekyll site to be built by GitHub Pages :-)
