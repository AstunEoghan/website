To use- clone locally and checkout the newlayout branch. Make your changes and 
and test locally after [setting up your pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

## Pushing to the live site

Once you're happy with your changes and wish to publish them:

* Pull any upstream changes, merge and test again
* Commit your changes and push to the gh-pages branch
* Wait a few minutes for the Jekyll site to be built by GitHub Pages :-)
