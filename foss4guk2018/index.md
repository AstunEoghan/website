<!-- <h1> FOSS4G UK 2018 </h1> -->

On the **8th to 9th of March 2018** (and the **10th for the Code Sprint**!), OSGeo:UK will be bringing together all those interested in free and open source geospatial software for FOSS4G UK 2018. 

# Agenda

Please see a PDF of our current agenda (subject to change) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E6aGXunMCBoqj_T5wQS40qqr0PowP9EJ/view).

# Tickets and Registration

Due to the restriction in size of the venue, we have a capacity of 130 people in total. We will be releasing tickets in batches to help allow a fairer distribution of tickets.

Tickets are now available [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/foss4guk-2018-tickets-42528417642 )

If you feel that you are under financial circumstances that prevent you from being able to attend, please contact us to discuss.

# Sponsorship

We want to keep the cost of entry to FOSS4GUK as low as possible, whilst also providing a quality event - sponsorship will help us to do that. If you are interested in sponsoring FOSS4GUK, there are opportunities for the smallest to the largest companies, and even for one man bands. 

Please see the **[sponsorship form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17Qu_bqh6U_gkkv1KK6QLSWdwaTXnAwibh-G4gW0nhU0/edit)** for more information and to register interest.

### Accommodation

London has many levels of accomodation available. It's worth keeping an eye on websites like [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/), [trivago](https://www.trivago.co.uk/) and [expedia](https://www.expedia.co.uk/Hotels). 

We've created a predefined search on Google Maps that might [help you narrow down your choice](https://encrypted.google.com/search?safe=strict&hl=en&rlla=0&hotel_dates=2018-03-07%2C2018-03-10&sz=14&hotel_ds=1&tbm=lcl&ei=xwUsWomTOcT_ULarj8AE&hotel_occupancy=2&q=hotels&oq=hotels&gs_l=psy-ab.3...109705.110150.0.110267.6.4.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..6.0.0....0.RhrW4b011bg#rlfi=hd:2018-03-07,2018-03-10;si:;mv:!1m3!1d40195.88868441375!2d-0.07171367998103051!3d51.510579556401375!3m2!1i1500!2i777!4f13.1;tbs:lf_hd:-1,lf_ho:2,lrf:!1m4!1u13!2m2!13m1!1b1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e6!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e4!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e5!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e10!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e2!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e3!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e7!2m1!1e4!2m1!1e13!2m25!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e6!4m2!11m1!1e4!4m2!11m1!1e5!4m2!11m1!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e2!4m2!11m1!1e1!4m2!11m1!1e3!4m2!11m1!1e7!2m7!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e3!4m2!17m1!1e8!2m26!1e7!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u150!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u200!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u250!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u400!3sGBP!5m4!7m3!1m1!1u153!3sGBP!2m4!1e2!5m2!2m1!2e8!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:6).

Here are some hotels the committee has stayed in previously and can recommend:

* [Qbic](https://qbichotels.com/london-city/) (Aldgate) - cheap, modern, clean and affordable. Located in Aldgate it's a short tube to Farringdon, and walkable for the brave.
* [Town Hall](https://www.townhallhotel.com/) (Bethnal Green) - set in Bethnal Greens old town hall, great hotel for more lenient budgets.


### Code Sprint

As it stands we currently have a proposed venue that we will annouce in the next month or so upon confirmation. 

<!-- ### Students

Thanks to the generosity of the AGI and our other sponsors we have some free places available for students.  If you would like to attend FOSS4GUK mail the team at osgeouk@gmail.com with the subject 'Student Bursary' telling them:
